# heterophily-data-viz
Graphika, where I work, maps social networks to produce contextual insights into online behavior. Data visualization plays a huge role in this process, and here I use a js library to create accurate bar-graph visualizations.

I have used and customized chart.js, an html5 visualization library, to produce graphs showing the 'heterophily/homophily' scores for different 'clusters' and 'groups' within a Graphika map. Sound confusing? Perhaps it is.. There is a lot of secret sauce that goes into making these maps that I can't quite divulge...

Our lead front end developer has called chart.js, "D3 for babies", and that is certainly fine for me. Had a hell of a time and needed some help in just creating a 'for'-loop that doesn't break. enjoy
